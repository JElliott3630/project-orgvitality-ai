But | will stay in the last week or so | have not notice the ITM's rebooting in the middle of a transaction.\nI think we are making strides towards aligning our priorities. The one change that will make us more effective and competitive is having more resources to focus on the large number of initiatives that we continue\nAlignment of goals & priorities\nto undertake\ninternal , remind us of SECU's ultimate vision every so often. There are some who feel that things happen and they really don't know why. There also seems that management IS listening to the frontline staff more than\ninternal communications\never versus a high paid consultant from a distant land who may or may not understand our local markets.\nStrategy & direction There needs to be more accountability for the companies we outsource to. Members need to feel that they are speaking to a person that cares about them and their needs.\n\nWe need another FTE.
