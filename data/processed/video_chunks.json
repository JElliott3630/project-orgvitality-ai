This is just who's downloaded or not downloaded their report. If you click on the red part of the donut, the table below will populate with the managers who have not yet downloaded their report.  You could select all and then using this toggle, send them a note to download their report.  If I click to the middle table here, I can see who's logged in action plan. And I can of course filter by which dimension they've logged in on the far right. I can see action plan status.",
