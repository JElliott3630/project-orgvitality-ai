There are some who feel that things happen and they really don't know why. There also seems that management IS listening to the frontline staff more than\ninternal communications\never versus a high paid consultant from a distant land who may or may not understand our local markets.\nStrategy & direction There needs to be more accountability for the companies we outsource to.

This section helps you identify areas to focus on.\nStep 2: Observe the boxes across the top representing different dimensions of the survey.\nStep 3: Use the arrow on the right or left to navigate through these dimensions.\nStep 4: Click on any dimension box to view detailed items related to that dimension. For instance, clicking on the \"Capabilities\" dimension will display all related items in the box below. This box will show the percentage of favorable responses, the response count, and any relevant comparisons.\nStep 5: Hover over the percentage of favorable responses to see the number of favorable responses and additional comparison details. These comparisons might include trend comparisons, overall comparisons, or comparisons against specific business units, depending on your company's settings.\nStep 6: Notice the color and symbols associated with each score in the survey results. Scores with no statistically significant difference appear in black text without arrows. A statistically significant increase is indicated by green text with an up arrow, while a significant decrease is shown in red with a down arrow.\nStep 7: Understand what constitutes statistical significance in your data. For groups with over 100 participants, a difference of five points or more is significant. For groups of 50 to 99, the difference must be 10 points, and for groups smaller than 50, it needs to be 15 points. This scale adjusts based on group size, as smaller groups can cause more significant shifts in data.\nStep 8: Check the right side of your screen to see the \"Who Responded\" section, which displays your response rate, response count, and head count.\nStep 9: Evaluate whether your survey's response rate is adequate. A response rate above 75% is generally considered good and statistically representative of your organization's population.",

Enter the desired name in the search bar at the top. For example, type \"Talia minus Andy High Potential\".\nStep 9: Save your new data group by clicking Save. This action will redirect you to your data group library.\nStep 10: Review all existing data groups in your library, including standard and custom groups you've created. You can sort these by type for easier navigation.\nStep 11: Select any number of data groups by checking the boxes on the far left of each listing.\nStep 12: Utilize the blue button at the top to export selected groups to Excel, share them with other users, or create a new report.\nStep 13: Click Create Report to finalize your selections and start building your report based on the custom data group.",
